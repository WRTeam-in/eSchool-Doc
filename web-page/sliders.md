# Sliders

![Sliders](../static/images/web/7.png)

In the sliders section of the Admin panel, admin can effortlessly manage slider images for web pages. They have the flexibility to upload images for both the web and app or specify them exclusively for one platform. If no slider image is uploaded, default sliders are automatically displayed on web pages, ensuring a visually appealing experience for users.
