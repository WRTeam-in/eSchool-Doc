In the events section of the Admin panel, administrators can efficiently add and manage both single-day and multi-day upcoming events. These events, encompassing holidays and other notable occasions, are presented on the webpage in a date-wise format. The news and events section exhibits events starting from today's date, with a maximum limit of 6 entries. This streamlined approach guarantees that users remain informed about upcoming events without inundating them with excessive information.
