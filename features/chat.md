# Chat

The Chat feature in our eSchool project enables students to communicate with their class teachers, while parents can chat with any of their children's teachers. Teachers can easily engage with parents and students associated with their classes. The feature includes real-time messaging using notifications, and supports text, images, and file sharing. It ensures a seamless and organized communication experience for all users.
