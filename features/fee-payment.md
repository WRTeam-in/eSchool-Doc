## Supported Payment Gateways for Online Fee Payment:
- Razorpay
- Stripe
- PayStack
- FlutterWave

## Fees Configuration

To utilize the fees feature with online payment, administrators must complete this form by providing their payment gateway details such as Razorpay or Stripe. Additionally, they need to specify the currency code and symbol for the payments.

## Session Year

Parents can pay their students' fees only for the current session year. Each student can be assigned to a particular class in a session year and a different class in the subsequent session year. In this section, administrators can create new session years and manage existing ones.

When setting up a session year, administrators need to enter its name, starting date, ending date, fees due date, and fees due charges (in percentage). Optionally, administrators can enable installment fee payments and set up one or more installments with names, due dates, and due charges (in percentage).

These dates and charges will be applicable to students paying their fees in the current session year. Administrators can designate the current session year from the general settings in the system configuration.

## Fees Type

Administrators can create various types of fees from this section, such as exam fees, gym fees, sports fees, and more. Each fee type can have a title and description to provide additional context.

## Assign Fees Classes

Administrators can assign different types of fees to specific class sections in this section. These fees can either be optional or non-optional, and their amounts can vary for each class section.

For instance, sports fees could be $90 for Class 9A and $200 for Class 12B. Administrators can customize the amounts for individual fee types according to each class.

## Fees Paid

Administrators can view the fee payment status of all students from various classes in this section. If students and parents are making payments directly to the admin/principal using cash or cheque, the admin can record those payments in the compulsory/optional fee payment section.

Furthermore, administrators have the convenience of downloading PDF receipts for fees that have already been paid.

## Fees Transactions Logs

This section displays logs of all fees transactions. Administrators can access detailed information about each transaction related to fees.

## Fees Online Payment (Parent Login eSchool App)

Parents can conveniently pay their student's current session year fees online through the application. In the student options -> fees section, they can access information about all session years where fees have been paid and download receipts for their records.

Parents have the flexibility to pay pending fees for the current session year. They can either make full payments for compulsory fees or, if installment options are enabled, pay one or more installments. Additionally, they can pay optional fees at any time without concerns about due charges.

In the settings -> fees transaction option, parents can review all fee payment transactions, including the amount and status of each payment made.

## Compulsory Fee Payment Settings

The Admin can enable the compulsory fee payment mode from the Fees Configurations form. When this mode is activated, parents are required to pay the compulsory fees for their child before the due date to ensure the continuation of their child's studies and access to the student application.

The application-usage restriction will be activated only if the fee-payment is due after the free app usage date is reached. This can be added while setting-up fees settings while creating session year which defaults to compulsory fee payment's due date.

After the due date is reached, the student has to pay fees to use application either fully for the session year or installments (if enabled). If they choose to pay installments and after next installment is due, they'll again not be able to use application without paying the due installment first.

## Student Can Pay Their Own Fees

Admin can enable settings from the Fees Configurations form, which allows students to pay their fees. When the Admin enables the student fee payment mode, it activates the necessary options and features to facilitate fee payments by students.
