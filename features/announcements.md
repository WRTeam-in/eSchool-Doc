Announcements can be managed from this screen by both teachers and admins. It allows for effective communication and dissemination of important information within the school community.

To create an announcement, the title is mandatory. Additionally, admins and teachers can add a description and attach multiple files to the announcement, providing detailed information and additional resources if needed.

These announcements can be assigned to the notice board by the admin, ensuring that they are prominently displayed for everyone to see. Teachers can also assign announcements to their respective class sections, enabling targeted communication with specific groups of students.

Students will be able to see these announcements in the application, which can help the school's principal and teachers to:
- Share important school-wide news and updates
- Communicate changes in school policies or procedures
- Inform students about upcoming events, competitions, or workshops
- Provide resources and study materials for specific subjects or topics
- Announce academic achievements, awards, or recognition
- Remind students about assignment deadlines or exam schedules
- Promote community service opportunities or extracurricular activities
- Share safety guidelines and emergency protocols
- Celebrate special occasions and foster a sense of community
