## Create Lesson (Teacher Panel Login)

Teachers can effectively manage lessons for students in a specific class section and subject. When creating a lesson, teachers will see their class sections and subjects available for selection.

They can then provide a name and description for the lesson and even have the option to add multiple files to complement the lesson. Once created, these lessons will be visible to students from the respective class section and subject within the application.

Students can easily download and access the files attached to the lesson to enhance their learning experience.

## Create Topic (Teacher Panel Login)

Teachers can manage topics from this section. Each lesson can have multiple topics, and teachers can create them by selecting the appropriate class section, subject, and the associated lesson.

When creating a topic, teachers can provide a topic name and description, and optionally select relevant files to enrich the content.

Students will be able to view these topics within their lessons through the application, providing a well-organized and structured learning experience.
