The Admin also has the ability to edit or update these settings as needed. Once these configurations are in place, teachers and staff can proceed to apply for leave.

Teachers can apply for leave and check status of those from the application. Leave request can have date-range, but if there are any holiday days in that range they'll be auto-removed from the leave request. They can delete pending leave requests as well. Remaining and taken monthly leave count is also shown.

## Student Leave Management

Students or their parents can request leave directly through the eSchool app in a format similar to staff leave requests. They can choose specific days or a date range and select the typeâ€”first half, second half, or full day for each day in the request. Leave requests can't be made on holidays. Attachments, along with a reason for leave, can be added. Requests are sent to the class teacher, who can approve or decline with a comment. Once approved, the student's attendance status displays as "On Leave" while teachers take attendance, with the day marked as absent.
