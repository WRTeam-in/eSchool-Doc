## Mediums and Sections

The Academics feature in e-School allows the admin to define the mediums (languages) in which the school operates, such as English, Hindi, and Gujarati. Additionally, the admin can create sections for classes, such as A, B, C, and so on.

## Stream and Shifts

Streams are used to divide classes based on subject preferences, such as Arts, Commerce, or Science. By creating streams, schools can offer specialized education and personalized learning experiences.

Shifts are utilized to organize classes into different time-zones, like Morning or Afternoon, to accommodate students' schedules. With shifts, schools can efficiently manage classroom capacities and balance student-teacher ratios.

## Subjects

The admin can create new subjects within e-School. Each subject can be associated with one of the mediums and has a name, type (theory or practical), optional subject code, custom background color, and image to be displayed in the application. This allows for easy organization and identification of subjects across different classes.

## Class

In e-School, the admin can add classes by choosing the mediums and sections that each class will have. For example, selecting English as the medium and A, B, C as the sections will automatically create classes like 10 A English, 10 B English, and 10 C English. Similarly, selecting Gujarati as the medium and A, B, C as the sections will create classes like 10 A Gujarati, 10A Gujarati, and 10 C Gujarati. Optionally a shift can be chosen for any class to indicate the time-zone it'll be taken on. There is also an option of sub-dividing classes into streams based on student's subject preference.
