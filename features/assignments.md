## Create Assignment (Teacher Panel Login)

Teachers can create assignments for their class sections on a particular subject. When creating an assignment, teachers must provide a name and submission date for the assignment.

They can also add detailed instructions and files to provide students with additional information and resources. Moreover, teachers can specify the points that students can earn by submitting the assignment.

Furthermore, teachers have the option to allow resubmission of rejected assignments. In such cases, they must specify the extra days allowed for resubmission.

Students from the class section to which the assignment was assigned will see these assignments in the application. They can upload their files and submit the assignment to the teacher through the app.

## Assignment Submission

Admin and Teachers can view the submitted assignments in this section and accept or reject the submissions.

They also have the ability to provide feedback and assign points to the submitted assignments.

Students will be able to see the feedback and updated status of their submitted assignments in the "Submitted Assignment" section of the application.

Students now have the ability to include textual data along with their assignment files directly from the application. This feature allows students to provide additional context, explanations, or details related to their assignments, enhancing communication and clarity between students and instructors.
