By setting the maximum upload file limits, admins can restrict the number of files a user can attach in a single message, which helps manage server load and prevents spam. The maximum file upload size setting allows admins to cap the size of each uploaded file, ensuring that large files do not consume excessive bandwidth or storage space. Additionally, the maximum text message character limits setting defines the maximum length of a text message, promoting readability and preventing overly lengthy messages that could disrupt the conversation flow. These settings are crucial for maintaining a balanced and efficient chat system.","sidebar":"adminPanelSidebar"},"email-config":{"id":"email-config","title":"Email Configurations","description":"Send Email configurations so that system can send emails to registered users.","sidebar":"adminPanelSidebar"},"fee-payment":{"id":"fee-payment","title":"Fee payment Configurations","description":"Set Razorpay, stripe and Paystack credentials.
